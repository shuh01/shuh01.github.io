# 207. Course Schedule

**Difficulty: Medium**

*Related Topics: DFS/BFS, Graph, Topological Graph*

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

## Code:

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        degree = {}
        for i in range(len(prerequisites)):
            if prerequisites[i][0] in degree:
                degree[prerequisites[i][0]] += 1
            else:
                degree[prerequisites[i][0]] = 1

        for i in range(numCourses):
            if i not in degree:
                degree[i] = 0

        myq = deque()
        for i in degree:
            if degree[i] == 0:
                myq.append(i)
        while myq:
            curr = myq.popleft()
            for i in prerequisites:
                if i[1] == curr:
                    degree[i[0]] -= 1
                    if degree[i[0]] == 0:
                        myq.append(i[0])
        
        if sum(degree.values()) == 0: return True
        else: return False
```

## Topological Sort Pseudocode
```
function TopologicalSort( Graph G ):
  for each node in G:
    calculate the indegree
  start = Node with 0 indegree
  G.remove(start)
  topological_list = [start]
  While node with O indegree present:
    topological_list.append(node)
    G.remove(node)
    Update Indegree of present nodes
  Return topological_list
```

## Python Implementation
```python
from collections import defaultdict
class graph:
    def __init__(self, vertices):
        self.adjacencyList = defaultdict(list) 
        self.Vertices = vertices  # No. of vertices
    # function to add an edge to adjacencyList
    def createEdge(self, u, v):
        self.adjacencyList[u].append(v)
    # The function to do Topological Sort.
    def topologicalSort(self):
        total_indegree = [0]*(self.Vertices)
        for i in self.adjacencyList:
            for j in self.adjacencyList[i]:
                total_indegree[j] += 1
        queue = []
        for i in range(self.Vertices):
            if total_indegree[i] == 0:
                queue.append(i)
        visited_node = 0
        order = []
        while queue:
            u = queue.pop(0)
            order.append(u)
            for i in self.adjacencyList[u]:
                total_indegree[i] -= 1

                if total_indegree[i] == 0:
                    queue.append(i)
            visited_node += 1
        if visited_node != self.Vertices:
            print("There's a cycle present in the Graph.\nGiven graph is not DAG")
        else:
            print(order)
G = graph(6)
G.createEdge(0,1)
G.createEdge(0,2)
G.createEdge(1,3)
G.createEdge(1,5)
G.createEdge(2,3)
G.createEdge(2,5)
G.createEdge(3,4)
G.createEdge(5,4)
G.topologicalSort()
