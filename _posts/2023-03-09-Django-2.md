# HyperText Transfer Protocol

Wandering through linked documents on the internet

## Uniform Resource Locator (URL)

  http://     [data.pre4e.org]       /page1.htm

protocol            host              document

## HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol

- The dominant Application Layer Protocol on the internet.
- Invented for the Web - to retrieve HTML, Images, Documents, etc.
- Extended to handle data in addition to documents - RSS, Web Services, etc.
- Basic Concept: Make a connection - Request a document - Retrieve the document - Close the connection
- Internet and sockets were created in the 1970’s, HTTP was invented in 1990 and is an application protocol that runs atop sockets

## Internet Standards

- The standards for all of the internet protocols (inner workings) are developed by an organization
- Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
- Standards are called “RFCs” - “Request for Comments”

# Network Sockets

Phone calls for pair of applications

## TCP Connections / Sockets

In computer networking, an internet **socket** or network **socket** is an endpoint of a bidirectional inter-process communication flow across an **Internet** Protocol-based computer network, such as the **internet**.

## TCP Port Numbers

- A port is an application-specific or process-specific software communications endpoint
- It allows multiple networked applications to coexist on the same server
- There is a list of well-known TCP port numbers

## The World’s Simplest Browser

```python
#socket1.py

import socket

mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) #create socket
mysock.connect(('data.pr4e.org', 80))
cmd = 'GET http://data.pr4e.org/page1.htm HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n'.encode()
mysock.send(cmd)

while True:
	data = mysock.recv(512)
	if len(data) < 1:
		break
	print(data.decode(), end='')

mysock.close()
```

# In the server

## The World’s Simplest Web Server

```python
#server.py

from socket import *

def createServer():
	serversocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
	try:
		serversocket.bind(('localhost', 9000))
		serversocket.listen(5)
		while(1):
			(clientsocket, address) = serversocket.accept()

			rd = clientsocket.recv(5000).decode()
			pieces = rd.split("\n")
			if (len(pieces) > 0): print(pieces[0])

			data = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"
			data += "Connect-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\n"
			data += "\r\n"
			data += "<html><body>Hello World</body></html>\r\n\r\n"
			clientsocket.sendall(data.encode())
			clientsocket.shutdown(SHUT_WR)

	except KeyboardInterrupt:
		print("\nShutting down...\n");
	except Exception as exc:
		print("Error:\n");
		print(exc)
	
	serversocket.close()

print("Access http://localhost:9000")
createServer()

```

## A very simple Web Client

```python
#client1.py

import socket

mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) #create socket
mysock.connect(('127.0.0.1', 9000))
cmd = 'GET http://127.0.0.1/romeo.txt HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n'.encode()
mysock.send(cmd)

while True:
	data = mysock.recv(512)
	if len(data) < 1:
		break
	print(data.decode(), end='')

mysock.close()
```

## Even Simpler Web Client

```python
#client2.py

import urllib.request

fhand = urllib.request.urlopen('http://127.0.0.1:9000/romeo.txt')
for line in fhand:
	print(line.decode().strip())
```

# The Structure of a Django Application

## Django Terminology (I.e. folders)

- **Project** is a collection of **applications**

## Flow of a web request

- When the request arrives at Django app the incoming request URL is compared to the list of paths in **urls.py** in the variable **urlpatterns**
- When there is a url match, it selects a “**View**” which is a bit of code that handles any database access and then produces and delivers the response to the browser.
- The **view** access the database indirectly through an abstraction called a “**model**”
- This is a general web pattern called “**Model-View-Controller**” or **MVC**
