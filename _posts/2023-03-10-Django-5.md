# Model View Controller (MVC)

- The **MODEL** represents the information (the data) of the application and the business rules used to manipulate the data
    - The persistent data that we keep in the data store
- The **VIEW** corresponds to elements of the user interface such as text, checkbox items, and so forth
    - The HTML, CSS, etc. which makes up the look and feel of the application
- The **CONTROLLER** manages details involving the communication to the model of user actions
    - The code that does the thinking and decision making

## Tasks inside the server

- Process any user input data - possibly storing it in a database or making some other change to the database such as a delete
- Decide which screen to send back to the user
- Retrieve any needed data
- Produce the HTML response and send it back to the browser

# Views and Templates

## Views are the core of an application

- Django looks at the incoming request URL and uses **urls.py** to select a view
- The view from **views.py**
    - Handle any incoming data in the request and copy it to the database through the model
    - Retrieve data to put on the page from the database though the model
    - Produce the HTML that will become the response and return it to the browser
    

## Reading the URL

- When Django receives an HTTP request it parses it, uses some of the URL for routing purposes and passes parts of the URL to your code
- URL dispatcher

## Three Patterns for views (in **urls.py**)

- Requests are routed to a pre-defined class from Django itself
- Requeste are routed to a function in **views.py** that takes the http **request** as a parameter and returns a response
- Requests are routed to a class in **views.py** that has **get()** and **post()** methods that take the http **request** as a parameter and return a response

```python
#urls.py

from django.urls import path
from . import views
from django.views.generic import TemplateView

app_name='views'
urlpatterns=[
	#pre-defined class from Django
	path('', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='views/main.html')),
	#function from views.py
	path('funky', views.funky),
	path('danger', views.danger),
	path('game', views.game),
	path('rest/<int:guess>', views.rest),
	path('bounce', views.bounce),
	#our class from views.py
	path('main', views.MainView.as_view()),
	path('remain/<slug:guess>', views.RestMainView.as_view()),
]
```

## Request and Response Object

- Django uses request and response objects to pass information throughout Django application.
- When a page is requested by a browser, Django creates an **HttpRequest** object that contains metadata about the request.
- Then Django loads the appropriate view, passing the **HttpRequest** as the first argument to the view function. Each view is responsible for returning an **HttpResponse** object.
- The Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for **HttpRequest** and **HttpResponse** objects, are defined in the **django.http** module.

## HTTP Location Header

- You can send a “Redirect” response instead of a page response to communicate a “Location:” header to the browser
- The location header includes a URL that the browser is supposed to forward itself to
- It was originally used for web sites that moved form one URL to another

## Sending a Redirect from a view

```python
path('bounce', views.bounce)

from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

#This is a command to the browser
def bounce(request):
	return HttpResponseRedirect('https://www.google.com/simple.htm')
```

# Templates to organise HTML

## Templates

- Django generates HTML dynamically and conveniently by relying on **templates.**
- A template contains the static parts of the desired HTML output as well as some special syntax describing how dynamic content will be inserted.
- Django ships built-in backends for its own template system, creatively called the **Django Template Language (DTL)**.
- It is simply a text file which can be generated in any text-based format, containing **variables** and **tags**.

## Template Render Process

Render Data + Template → Render Engine → Rendered Output

## URL → View → Template

```python
https://samples.dj4e.com/tmpl/game/200

path('game/<slug:guess>', views.GameView.as_view())

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.views import view

class GameView(View):
	def get(self, request, guess):
		x = {'guess':int(guess)}
		return render(request, 'tmpl/cond.html', x)
```

## Templates in folders

- It is common to reuse the “**name**” of a template in several applications
- We use a technique called “**namespace**” so that each application can load its own templates
    - For the namespace to work, we need to put templates in a path that includes the **application name** twice.
    
    ```python
    favs/templates/favs/detail.html
    favsql/templates/favsql/detail.html
    forums/templates/forums/detail.html
    pics/templates/pics/detail.html
    ```
    

# Django Template Language (DTL)

## Template Tags / Code

```python
#Substitution
{% raw %}
{{ zap }}
{{ zap | safe }}

#Calling code
{% url 'cat-detail' cat.id %}
{% author.get_absolute_url %}

#Logic
{% if zap > 100 %}
{% endif %}

#Blocks
{% block content %}
{% endblock %}
{% endraw %}
```

## Template Inheritance

### Inheritance

- When we make a new template - we can extend an existing template and then add our own little bit to make our new class
- Another form of store and reuse

### Template Inheritance

Render Data + Base Template + Template → Render Engine → Rendered Output
