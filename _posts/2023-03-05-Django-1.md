## Getting data from server
- Each time the user clicks on an anchor tag with an href = value to switch to a new page, the browser makes a connection to the web server and issues a "Get" request - to GET the content of the page at the specified URL.
- The server returns the HTML document to the browser, which formats and displays the document to the user.
