# 189. Rotate Array

**Difficulty: Easy**

*Related Topics: Array, Math, Two Pointer*

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]


## Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        first = 0
        last = len(nums)-1
        temp = 0
        for i in range(k):
            temp = nums[last]
            nums.insert(first, temp)
            nums.pop()
        return nums
```       
### Feedbacks: 
I could solve this problem by just insert last element at index 0 and pop the list for k times. But it has O(n) time complexity which makes my code much slower than other algorithms used to solve this question. Also, I couldn't find a way to implement two pointers which the question was really asking for.
