# 53. Maximum Subarray

**Difficulty: Easy**

*Related Topics: Array, Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming*

Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.

## First Attempt:

Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        max = nums[0]
        for start in range(len(nums)):
            n = start+1
            sumNums = 0
            if start+1 == len(nums):
                if nums[start] >= max:
                    max = nums[start]
            else:
                while n < len(nums)+1:
                    sumNums = sum(nums[start:n])
                    if sumNums > max:
                        max = sumNums
                    n+=1
        return max
```
### Feedbacks: 
It gives me a time limit exceed error. So I should find an algorithm with better time complexity.

## Second Attempt:

Get the sum elements one by one from the beginning and if I get negative sum, I reset the sum to zero and start again, because subarray with sum
of negative numbers will not contribute to max sum of subarray. And compare current sum and max sum to get the final max sum.

Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        maxSum = nums[0]
        curSum = 0

        for n in nums:
            if curSum < 0:
                curSum = 0
            curSum += n
            maxSum = max(maxSum, curSum)
        return maxSum
```

### Feedbacks: 
It solves the question well. Beats 77% with runtime, but memory occupation needs improvement which only beats 11% of total submissions.
